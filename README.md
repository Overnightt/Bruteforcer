# Bruteforcer

**Bruteforcer** is a project written in C, developed to strengthen my understanding of the C programming language.

## Goal

The objective is to build a simple tool capable of brute-forcing passwords that the user enters as a parameter of the function.

## Current Features

- Prompts the user to enter a password.
- Runs a function that attempts to guess the password using brute-force, works by recursion.

## Weaknesses

- Inefficient
- High memory usage
- only works on short password
