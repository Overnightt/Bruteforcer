# Bruteforcer

**Bruteforcer** is a project written in C, developed to strengthen my understanding of the C programming language.

## Goal

The objective is to build a simple tool capable of brute-forcing passwords, and eventually extend it to support hashed passwords.

## Current Features

- Prompts the user to enter a password (up to 20 characters).
- Runs a function that attempts to recover the password using brute-force.

## Next Steps

- Add support for hashed passwords.
- Measure execution time to evaluate performance.
